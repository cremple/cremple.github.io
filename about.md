[Evento](https://github.com/boyney123/evento) a free to use open source Jekyll project I started that allows people to create internal/external events, showing times and information for anybody that wants to attend.

# The Problem I was trying to solve


At my current place of work we run internal speaker events called Brownbags.
 
Brownbags are a great platform and environment for professionals to speak about anything that interests them. 

The main problem I found was that there was no **easy to use** platform to see what Brownbags, Internal Training or other events are coming up or have already gone, so I created [Evento](https://github.com/boyney123/evento)

This free and opensource platform should allow any organisation or group to collect and share their events in one place.

If you would like to contribute to the project or folk it for your own organisation or group feel free.
